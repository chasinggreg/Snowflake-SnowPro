--- INTERSECT ---
/*
    -- The SQL INTERSECT clause/operator is used to combine two SELECT statements, 
       but returns rows only from the first SELECT statement that are identical to a row in the second SELECT statement. 
       This means INTERSECT returns only common rows returned by the two SELECT statements.
    -- Just as with the UNION operator, the same rules apply when using the INTERSECT operator
