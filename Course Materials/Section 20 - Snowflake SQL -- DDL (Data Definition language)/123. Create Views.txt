// create view
-- a materialized view is a database object that contains the results of a query. 
-- For example, it may be a local copy of data located remotely, 
--      or may be a subset of the rows and/or columns of a table or join result, or may be a summary using an aggregate function

create view myview as 
    select * 
    from "SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF001"."CUSTOMER" 
    where c_custkey <= 5;

select * from myview;
