// GRANT PRIVILEGES TO ROLE
-- Grants one or more access privileges on a securable object to a role. 
-- The privileges that can be granted are object-specific and are grouped into the following categories:
    -- Global privileges
    -- Privileges for account objects (resource monitors, virtual warehouses, and databases)
    -- Privileges for schemas
    -- Privileges for schema objects (tables, views, stages, file formats, UDFs, and sequences)


// GRANT ROLE
    -- Assigns a role to a user or another role:
    -- Granting a role to another role creates a “parent-child” relationship between the roles (also referred to as a role hierarchy).
    -- Granting a role to a user enables the user to perform all operations allowed by the role 
        -- (through the access privileges granted to the role).
