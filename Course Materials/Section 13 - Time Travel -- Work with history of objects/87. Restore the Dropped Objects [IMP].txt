-- DROPPING AND RESTORING OBJECTS --

When a table, schema, or database is dropped, it is not immediately overwritten or removed from the system. 
Instead, it is retained for the data retention period for the object, during which time the object can be restored. 
Once dropped objects are moved to Fail-safe, you cannot restore them.

-- The output includes all dropped objects and an additional DROPPED_ON column, which displays the date and time when the object was dropped. 
-- If an object has been dropped more than once, each version of the object is included as a separate row in the output.


/*

-- RESTORING OBJECTS --
A dropped object that has not been purged from the system (i.e. the object is displayed in the SHOW <object_type> HISTORY output) 
can be restored using the following commands:

Calling UNDROP restores the object to its most recent state before the DROP command was issued.

undrop table demo_db.employee_perm.employees;

undrop schema demo_db.employee;

undrop database development;

-- If an object with the same name already exists, UNDROP fails. 
-- You must rename the existing object, which then enables you to restore the previous version of the object.
