-- RULES for Subqueries:
    - You can place Subquery in following SQL clauses: WHERE, HAVING and FROM.
    - They can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE statements along with expression operator. 
      It could be equality operator or comparison operator such as =, >, =, <= and Like operator.
    - A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query and inner query is called as subquery.
    - The subquery generally executes first, and its output is used to complete the query condition for the main or outer query.
    - Subquery must be enclosed in parentheses.
    - Subqueries are on the right side of the comparison operator.
    - ORDER BY command cannot be used in a Subquery. GROUPBY command can be used to perform same function as ORDER BY command.
