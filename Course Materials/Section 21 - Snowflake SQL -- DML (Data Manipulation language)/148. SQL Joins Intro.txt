------------------------ JOINS ------------------------

/* 
What are Joins?
-- A SQL Join statement is used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them.
-- Common fields are also known as keys

Types of keys used in JOINS:
-- primary_key: primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table. 
                Primary keys must contain unique values. 
                A primary key column cannot have NULL values
                
-- foreign_key: A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together.
                A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table

What are the different types of joins?
-- There are 4 types of joins in SQL:
    - left join: Fetch everything from left table and just common data from right table
                 The rows for which there is no matching row on right side, the result-set will contain NULL. 
                 LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN
                 
    - right join: Fetch everything from right table and just common data from left table
                  The rows for which there is no matching row on left side, the result-set will contain NULL. 
                  RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN
                  
    - inner join: Fetch rows from both the tables as long as the condition satisfies
    
    - full join: Fetch the result-set by combining result of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. 
                 The result-set will contain all the rows from both the tables. 
                 The rows for which there is no matching, the result-set will contain NULL values.
    
-- one more special type of join    
    - self join

What happens in backend when a join is performed between two tables?
-- Crossproduct / Cartesian product: 
    - It returns the Cartesian product of both the tables. 
    - Cartesian product means Number of Rows present in Table 1 Multiplied by Number of Rows present in Table 2
    
Types of possible relationships between data in two tables:
    - 1 to 1
    - 1 to many
    - many to many
