/*
-- HAVING
    - The HAVING Clause enables you to specify conditions that filters the grouped results.
    - The WHERE clause place conditions on the selected columns, 
        whereas the HAVING clause places conditions on groups created by the GROUP BY clause.
    - The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.
